# Food App Tracker

Food app tracker is a web app that does two things: 
1) It helps user easily keep a detailed record of their food intake.
2) It provides easily understood, detailed nutritional analysis, so that users can easily see where their diet might benefit from tweaking.

Future updates are going to expand on this functionality and streamline the user experience. 

F.A.T. uses ReactJS, PostgreSQL (Knex), Express, Brunch, Axios and Skeleton.

## Installation

No installation necessary, though a mobile app is in the planning stages.

## Usage

To test the app, just go to https://food-tracker-app.herokuapp.com/, create an account, and start recording what you eat.
